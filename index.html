          <p>
            Hi, here below this text are some of the projects I did. More about me - I get sick very easily, I love to play video games and I love to sleep.

        <h2>My Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a link to your CYOA project and some text about
          it here.

        <h2>Sources &amp; Attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.
